Lisa, 26 - Medicine Student

"Man can alter his life by altering his thinking"

Lisa is in the middle of her masters degree in Medicine. 
One of her research topics is in dementia so she 
is always searching for new ways to help struggling persons.
Also she loves it to solve problems and to challenge herself with
mind games. 

She doesn't have any experience in Virtual Reality, 
but is interested in new technologies.



name, age, occupation, quote, experience level and some sentences

The end users for Puzzler are likely to be people who are new to VR,
but who have already experienced various games in their life. They are 
probably going to be in their mid twenties and own a next-gen smartphone. 
And I hope they enjoy puzzle games!
